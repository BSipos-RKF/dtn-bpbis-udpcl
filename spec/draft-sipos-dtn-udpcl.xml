This document describes a UDP-based convergence layer (UDPCL) for Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN).
This version of the UDPCL protocol clarifies requirements of RFC7122, specifically about multicast uses, and updates to the Bundle Protocol (BP) contents, encodings, and convergence layer requirements in BP Version 7.
Specifically, the UDPCL uses CBOR-encoded BPv7 bundles as its service data unit being transported and provides a reliable transport of such bundles.
This version of UDPCL also includes security and extensibility mechanisms.

      <t>
This document describes the UDP-based convergence-layer protocol for Delay-Tolerant Networking.
Delay-Tolerant Networking is an end-to-end architecture providing communications in and/or through highly stressed environments, including those with intermittent connectivity, long and/or variable delays, and high bit error rates.
More detailed descriptions of the rationale and capabilities of these networks can be found in "Delay-Tolerant Network Architecture" <xref target="RFC4838"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
An important goal of the DTN architecture is to accommodate a wide range of networking technologies and environments.
The protocol used for DTN communications is the Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7) <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis"/>, an application-layer protocol that is used to construct a store-and-forward overlay network.
BPv7 requires the services of a "convergence-layer adapter" (CLA) to send and receive bundles using the service of some "native" link, network, or Internet protocol.
This document describes one such convergence-layer adapter that uses the well-known User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
This convergence layer is referred to as UDP Convergence Layer (UDPCL).
For the remainder of this document, the abbreviation "BP" without the version suffix refers to BPv7.
      </t>
      <t>
The locations of the UDPCL and the BP in the Internet model protocol stack (described in <xref target="RFC1122"/>) are shown in Figure 1.
In particular, when BP is using UDP as its bearer with UDPCL as its convergence layer, both BP and UDPCL reside at the application layer of the Internet model.

This document describes the format of the protocol data units passed between entities participating in UDPCL communications.
This document does not address:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
The format of protocol data units of the Bundle Protocol, as those are defined elsewhere in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis"/>.
This includes the concept of bundle fragmentation or bundle encapsulation.
The UDPCL transfers bundles as opaque data blocks.
          </li>
          <li>
Mechanisms for locating or identifying other bundle entities (peers) within a network or across an internet.
The mapping of Node ID to potential convergence layer (CL) protocol and network address is left to implementation and configuration of the BP Agent and its various potential routing strategies.
          </li>
          <li>
Logic for routing bundles along a path toward a bundle's endpoint.
This CL protocol is involved only in transporting bundles between adjacent entities in a routing sequence.
          </li>
          <li>
Logic for performing rate control and congestion control of bundle transfers, both incoming and outgoing from a UDPCL entity.
          </li>
          <li>
Policies or mechanisms for issuing Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) certificates; provisioning, deploying, or accessing certificates and private keys; deploying or accessing certificate revocation lists (CRLs); or configuring security parameters on an individual entity or across a network.
          </li>
          <li><!-- 
Uses of TLS which are not based on PKIX certificate authentication (see <xref target="sec-security-tlsnopki"/>) or in which authentication of both entities is not possible (see <xref target="sec-security-tlsnoauth"/>).
           --></li>
        </ul>
        <t>
Any UDPCL implementation requires a BP agent to perform those above listed functions in order to perform end-to-end bundle delivery.

This is the notional UDPCL application that initiates UDPCL transfers.
This design, implementation, configuration, and specific behavior of such an entity is outside of the scope of this document.
However, the concept of an entity has utility within the scope of this document as the container and initiator of transfers.
The relationship between a UDPCL entity and UDPCL sessions is defined as follows:

            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
A UDPCL Entity MAY actively perform any number of transfers and should do so whenever the entity has a bundle to forward to another entity in the network.

              <li>
A UDPCL Entity MAY support zero or more passive listening elements that listen for transfers from other entities in the network, including non-unicast transfers.

      <name>General Protocol Description</name>
      <t>
The service of this protocol is the transmission of DTN bundles via the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
This document specifies the optional fragmention of bundles, procedures for DTLS setup and teardown, and a set of messages and entity requirements.
The general operation of the protocol is as follows.
      </t>
      <section anchor="sec-cl-services">
        <name>Convergence Layer Services</name>
        <t>
This version of the UDPCL provides the following services to support the over-laying Bundle Protocol agent.
In all cases, this is not an API definition but a logical description of how the CL can interact with the BP agent.
Each of these interactions can be associated with any number of additional metadata items as necessary to support the operation of the CL or BP agent.
        </t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>Begin Transmission:</dt>
          <dd>
The principal purpose of the UDPCL is to allow a BP agent to transmit bundle data to one or more other entities.
The receiver of each transfer is identified by an (destination) IPv4 or IPv6 address and a UDP port number (see <xref target="sec-operation"/> for details).
The CL does not necessarily perform any transmission queueing, but may block while transmissions are being processed at the UDP layer.
Any queueing of transmissions is the obligation of the BP agent.
          </dd>
          <dt>Transmission Started:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when a bundle transmission begins sending UDP datagrams.
Once started, there is no notion of a UDPCL transfer failure; a BP agent has to rely on bundle-level administrative reporting to track bundle progress.
Because of potential queueing or DTLS setup time, this may be delayed from the BP agent providing the bundle-to-transmit.
          </dd>
          <dt>Transmission Finished:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when a bundle has been fully transmitted.
This is not a positive indication that any next-hop receiver has either received or processed the transfer.
          </dd>
          <dt>Reception Started:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when a bundle transfer has begun, which may include information about the total size of a fragmented transfer.
          </dd>
          <dt>Reception Finished:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when a bundle has been fully transferred from a peer entity.
The transmitter of each transfer is identified by an (source) IPv4 or IPv6 address and a UDP port number (see <xref target="sec-operation"/> for details).
Because transfers occur as atomic units at the BP layer, there is no notion of a partially received bundle or a failed reception.
          </dd>
          <dt>Attempt DTLS Session:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL allows a BP agent to preemptively attempt to establish a DTLS session with a peer entity.
Each session attempt can send a different set of session negotiation parameters as directed by the BP agent.
          </dd>
          <dt>Terminate DTLS Session:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL allows a BP agent to preemptively terminate an established DTLS session with a peer entity.
The terminate request is on a per-session basis.
          </dd>
          <dt>DTLS Session State Changed:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when a DTLS session state changes.
The possible DTLS session states are defined in <xref target="RFC6347"/>.
          </dd>

      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-pkix-env">
        <name>PKIX Environments and CA Policy</name>
        <t>
This specification gives requirements about how to use PKIX certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA), but does not define any mechanisms for how those certificates come to be.
The UDPCL uses the exact same mechanisms and makes the same assumptions as TCPCL in <xref section="3.4" target="I-D.ietf-dtn-tcpclv4"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-policy-fragmentation">
        <name>Fragmentation Policies</name>
        <t>
It is a implementation matter for a sending entity to determine the path maximum transmit unit (MTU) to be used as a target upper-bound UDP datagram size.
Some mechanisms to perform MTU discovery are defined in <xref target="RFC8899"/>.
All IP packets sent by a UDPCL entity SHOULD have the "don't fragment" bit set to allow detection of path MTU issues.
        </t>
        <t>
The priority order of fragmentation is the following:
        </t>
        <ol>
          <li>
When possible, bundles too large to fit in one path-MTU-sized packet SHOULD be fragmented at the BP layer.
Bundle payload fragmentation does not help a large bundle if extension blocks are a major contributor to bundle size, so in some circumstances BP layer fragmentation will not reduce the bundle size sufficiently.
It is outside the scope of UDPCL to manage BP agent fragmentation policies; bundles are received from the BP agent either already fragmented or not.
          </li>
          <li>
Bundles too large to fit in one path-MTU-sized packet SHALL be fragmented as a UDPCL transfer (see <xref target="sec-ext-transfer"/>).
Fragmentation at this level treats bundle transfers as opaque data, so it is independent of bundle block sizes or counts.
          </li>
          <li>
All IP packets larger than expected path MTU SHALL be fragmented by the transmitting entity to fit within one path MTU.
Because of the issues listed in <xref section="3.2" target="RFC8085"/>, it is best to avoid IP fragmentation as much as possible.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <t>
A UDPCL entity SHOULD NOT proactively drop an outgoing transfer due to datagram size.
If intermediate network nodes drop IP packets it is an implementation matter to receive network feedback.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Error Checking Policies</name>
        <t>
The core Bundle Protocol specification assumes that bundles are transferring over an erasure channel, i.e., a channel that either delivers packets correctly or
not at all.
        </t>
        <t>
A UDP transmitter SHALL NOT disable UDP checksums.
A UDP receiver SHALL NOT disable the checking of received UDP checksums.
        </t>
        <t>
Even when UDP checksums are enabled, a small probability of UDP packet corruption remains.
In some environments, it may be acceptable for a BP agent to occasionally receive corrupted input.
In general, however, a UDPCL entity SHOULD insure the a bundle's blocks are either covered by a CRC or a BPSec integrity check.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Congestion Control Policies</name>
        <t>
The applications using UDPCL for bundle transport SHALL conform to the congestion control requirements of <xref section="3.1" target="RFC8085"/>.
The application SHALL either perform active congestion control of bundles or behave as the Low Data-Volume application as defined in <xref section="3.1.3" target="RFC8085"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
When nodes have bidirectional transfer capability, the bundle deletion reason code "traffic pared" can be used by a receiving agent to signal to the bundle source application that throttling of bundles along that path SHOULD occur.

      <name>UDPCL Operation</name>
      <t>
This section defines the UDPCL protocol and its interactions with under-layers (IP and UDP) and over-layers (BP).
The section is organized from the network layer up toward the BP layer.
      </t>
      <section>
        <name>Destination Address</name>
        <t>
The earlier UDPCL specification in <xref target="RFC7122"/> did not include guidance on IP addressing and potential use of multicast, though the architecture of <xref target="RFC4838"/> explicitly includes multicast and anycast as expected network modes.
        </t>
        <t>
The BP agent determines the mapping from destination EID to next-hop CL parameters, including transfer destination address.
Some EIDs represent unicast destinations and others non-unicast destinations as defined in <xref section="4.2.5.1" target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis"/>.
The unicast-ness of an EID does not necessarily correspond with the unicast-ness, as some bundle routing schemes involve attempting multiple parallel paths to a unicast endpoint.
        </t>
        <t>
For unicast transfers to a single node, the destination address SHALL be a unicast IPv4 or IPv6 address.
When performing unicast transfers, a UDPCL entity SHOULD restrict the network to one protected by IPsec or some other under-layer security mechanism (e.g., a virtual private network).
        </t>
        <t>
For multicast transfers to one or more nodes, the destination address SHALL be a multicast IPv4 <xref target="IANA-IPv4-MCAST"/> or IPv6 <xref target="IANA-IPv6-MCAST"/> address.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>UDP Header</name>
        <t>
To perform a transfer, the active entity SHALL transmit a UDP datagram to a listening passive entity in accordance with <xref target="RFC0768"/>, typically by using the services provided by the operating system.
Destination port number 4556 has been assigned by IANA as the Registered Port number for the UDP convergence layer and SHALL be used as a default.
Other destination port numbers MAY be used per local configuration.
Determining a peer's destination port number (if different from the registered UDPCL port number) is up to the implementation.
Any source port number MAY be used for UDPCL transfers.
Typically an operating system assigned number in the UDP Ephemeral range (49152-65535) is used.

      <section anchor="sec-udpcl-messaging">
        <name>UDPCL Messaging</name>
        <t>
The lower layer of UDPCL communication is individual-datagram messaging.
For backward compatibility with <xref target="RFC7122"/>, UDPCL has no explicit message type identifier.
The message type is inferred by the inspecting the data contents according to the following rules:

All encoded BP version 7 bundles begin with a CBOR array head in accordance with <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis"/>, and can include a self-described CBOR tag 55799.
Data with a leading octet value indicating CBOR array (major type 4) or containing any number of CBOR tags (major type 6) with ultimate value being a CBOR array SHALL be treated as a BPv7 bundle.

In addition to the UDPCL specific messaging, immediately after a DTLS Initiation (see <xref target="sec-ext-starttls"/>) the DTLS handshake sequence will begin.
Data with a leading octet value of 0x16 SHALL be treated as a DTLS handshake record in accordance with <xref section="4.1" target="RFC6347"/>.

If the datagram with the DTLS Initiation extension is not recevied by an entity, the entity SHOULD still detect the DTLS handshake records and start the handshake sequence at that point.
Data with a leading octet value of 0x17--0x19 SHALL be treated as a DTLS sequencing failure; DTLS non-handshake records should never be seen by the UDPCL messaging layer.

Extensions to UDPCL are encoded per-datagram in a single CBOR map as defined in <xref target="sec-udpcl-messaging"/>.
Each UDPCL extension item SHALL be identified by a unique integer (the Extension ID) used as a key in the Extension Map.
Extension ID values are listed in <xref target="sec-iana-extension-types"/>.
Receivers SHALL ignore extension items with unknown Extension ID and continue to process known extension items.

      <t>
This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <xref target="RFC7942"/>.
The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
Readers are advised to note that other implementations can exist.
      </t>
      <t>
An example implementation of the this draft of UDPCL has been created as a GitHub project <xref target="github-dtn-demo-agent"/> and is intended to use as a proof-of-concept and as a possible source of interoperability testing.
This example implementation uses D-Bus as the CL-BP Agent interface, so it only runs on hosts which provide the Python "dbus" library.
      </t>

A wireshark dissector for UDPCL has been created as a GitHub project <xref target="github-dtn-wireshark"/> and has been kept in-sync with the latest encoding of this specification.

This section separates security considerations into threat categories based on guidance of BCP 72 <xref target="RFC3552"/>.
      </t>
      <section>
        <name>Threat: Passive Leak of Bundle Data</name>
        <t>
The UDPCL does not provide transport security, and does not ensure security of data-at-rest or end-to-end bundle security.
The UDPCL exposes all bundle data to passive eavesdroppers.
        </t>
        <t>
The block confidentiality mechanisms defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec"/> are to be used instead.
These mechanisms can not cover the bundle's primary block, so that data is necessarily available to eavesdroppers.
A technique such as encrypted bundle encapsulation <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bibect"/> can be used to protect primary block data.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-threat-node-impersonation">
        <name>Threat: BP Node Impersonation</name>
        <t>
The UDPCL does not provide any guarantees of or binding to the source of transferred bundles.
        </t>
        <t>
One mitigation is to use the block integrity mechanisms defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec"/> with a security context which provides node identity binding.

      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Threat: Denial of Service</name>
        <t>
The behaviors described in this section all amount to a potential denial-of-service to a UDPCL entity.
The denial-of-service could be limited to an individual UDPCL entity, or could affect all entities on a host or network segment.
        </t>
        <t>
An entity can send a large amount of data to a UDPCL entity, requiring the receiving entity to handle the data.
The victim entity can block UDP packets from network peers which are thought to be incorrectly behaving within network.
        </t>
        <t>
The keepalive mechanism can be abused to waste throughput within a network link which would otherwise be usable for bundle transmissions.

Specifications of new extension types need to define the CBOR item structure of the extension data as well as the purpose and relationship of the new extension to existing session/transfer state within the baseline UDPCL sequencing.
Receiving entities will ignore items with unknown Extension ID, and that behavior needs to be considered by new extensino types.

Specifications of new well-known DTN endpoints need to define the encoded (uint) value as well as the meaning of the service.
